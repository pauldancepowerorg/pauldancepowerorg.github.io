**UPDATE:**

On the 14th July 2012 , the Jade Millington Performers will be at the
Royal Victoria Country Park to help celebrate the Southampton leg of the
Olympic Torch’s journey.

We will be dancing between 15:00 and 18:00 lending our support to one of
our chosen charities, Macmillan Cancer Support.  We’ll be joined there
by Macmillan’s Ambassador Gina Scappaticci.

The JMPs are proud to announce that we will be not only performing, but
giving free street dance master classes at the 2012 Southampton Olympic
torch event this summer.

More details will follow, but we just wanted to share the great news!

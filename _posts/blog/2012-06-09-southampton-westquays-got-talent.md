On Saturday June 9th, the Jade Millington Performers will be opening WestQuay’s Got Talent.

This is an event based loosely on the TV show, but it is a non-competitive, fun event interspersed with messages around stroke and will be hosted by the breeze 107.8.

Acts will be ‘judged’ in a similar way to those on the TV show but as this is not a competitive event, comments will be light hearted.

We’ll be dancing at 11.30 for about 30 minutes so come on down and give your support for a very important cause.

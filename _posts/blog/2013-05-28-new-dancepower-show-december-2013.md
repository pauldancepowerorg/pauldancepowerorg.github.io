Dance Power are proud to be back at the Mayflower Theatre.

Since 1996 the Jade Millington Performers have been producing the biggest, most sensational and inspiring dance performances on the south coast, with ‘Dance Power’.

Each show has been crammed with jaw dropping routines, special effects, and stage sets, and our show on the 1st December will be no different!

Dance Power will be the most fun you’ll have all year! It doesn’t matter what your age.

This immensely entertaining roller coaster ride will have you on the edge of your seats. Something you will not want to miss out on.

This production will be performed by your very own south coast talent.

If you’d like to book seats for our show on December 1st, then head on over to the Mayflower box office on Thursday 25th April where you can book online.

	  <p>I can without reservation, endorse and support the work Jade does. She works very hard working with young people, to put on these fabulous shows for the general public. When you see the youngsters at the start of the process as I have, then see them perform you'll be amazed at how they blossom and grow as people, learn new skills, new friendships, become very disciplined in their work which continues into their everyday lives. In fact, turning out very model young citizens which we all like to see. Jade works tirelessly for their shows and puts herself on the line for these projects. I was very lucky to meet Jade and see her show in 1999. I was just amazed that she still has the same drive and passion. To this end I would like to emphasise that this is a show to a very high professional level and I know how much the parents and the youngsters get out of it. The sets and choreography are stunning in these shows, one of the best things I have ever seen. I am now looking forward to the 1st December performance at the Mayflower Theatre - a great setting for a great show. I can truly say if you can get to see Dance Power, then you must. It's so professional and to see these young people transformed into great artists in our Mayflower is an opportunity not to be missed. If there are any head teachers out there, or sponsors, this is a great opportunity for you to come forwards.</p>

	  <p>I have known Jade, in both a professional and personal capacity for several years. In this time, I have always found her to be honest, trustworthy, and highly motivated. Jade teaches Street Jam dance classes in a number of schools in the Southampton area, as well as additional lessons within the local community. Having worked with Jade at a previous school, Shirley Junior school, I can say with confidence that her fun packed classes are an excellent way to improve children's fitness levels and raise their self esteem. In the time I have known Jade she has had many successes including a number of outstanding dance shows at both the Southampton Guildhall and Mayflower Theatre. The shows are highly professional and provide children from a wide range of backgrounds with the opportunity to perform in front of a very large audience. Having taken a group of children from Shirley Juniors to perform in one of Jade's shows, I can say with confidence that it was a fulfilling experience for all who took part. Jade can only be described as an excellent and talented dance teacher who would be an asset to any establishment she chooses to work with in the future. It was a great pleasure to work with Jade and I would recommend her, without reservation, to any school looking to extend the range of extra-curricular activities they offer to their pupils.</p>

	  <p>Students from Jade Millington’s Dance Power showed off their skills recently at the Stroke Association’s Easter Fun Charity Day at WestQuay in Southampton in April 2012. The Stroke Association, which has a base in Southampton, is WestQuay’s national charity of the year for 2012. During two half hour performances the students from the dance school entertained WestQuay shoppers and visitors with lively and colourful performances from the hit musical Grease, as well as some fantastic examples of street dancing and other contemporary styles. The Stroke Association would like to thank the performers and the dance school for their support and look forward to their participation in the charity’s next event ‘WestQuay’s Got Talent’ on June 9th 2012.</p>

	  <p>Dance Power have been a wonderful support to Macmillan over the last few years. Jade and her dancers have supported a variety of Macmillan events, always with their characteristic enthusiasm commitment and talent. In particular Dance Power were the cornerstone of our involvement with West Quay in 2011, where they tirelessly entertained the crowds to share both their love of dance and commitment to Macmillan, inspiring the shoppers to donate and get involved – raising thousands and thousands as a result. From fire-walks to Olympic torch events, Jade and her dancers are always there for us to add their unique brand of energy and joy. The variety of the dances, the colour and flair of the costumes, the obvious camaraderie between the dancers and the precision and creativity of their routines really is inspirational and uplifting. Whenever Dance Power start their routines, the rest of the world stops, and gets caught up in their infectious energy – they really are a force to be reckoned with, and Macmillan has been very lucky indeed to benefit from the value they add to our activities.

	  <p>We were lucky enough to be invited to Jade Millington's production 'The Power of Dance' at the Nuffield Theatre last July. The show was energetic and inspiring, with bold and challenging choreography. All of the performers were excellent and faultless in their delivery of the routines. Jade kindly came to school to provide the pupils with dance workshops later in the term. These were great fun and enjoyed by all the five to eleven year olds that took part. This academic year she has been running a Street Jam dance class on Wednesdays after school. Pupils participating in the class are full of enthusiasm and keen to participate each week. I would recommend Street Jam as it promotes team work, positive self-esteem and is a fun alternative form of exercise.</p>
